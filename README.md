# leetcode-solutions
This is a public repository of my personal solutions to LeetCode problems.  
Most solutions are written in Python and include comments to explain the logic.

## Why I Made This
I'm using LeetCode to improve my problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews.  
This repo helps me track my progress and share what Iâ€™ve learned.

## Notes
- Problems are added as I solve them.
- Some solutions may include multiple approaches.
- Feel free to explore or suggest improvements!
